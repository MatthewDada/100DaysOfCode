## I am basically just documenting my progress in this 100daysofcoding exercise journey.

### I am also using this medium to learn how to use git, github, and vs-code.

#### Nothing too serious.

#### Day 9, 10, and 13 missing--these days were basically used to learn about debugging, how to improve codes, and improve on the codes that have been written.
